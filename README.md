## How to run the project
1. Create a project using files in the 'Verilog' folder in ModelSim
2. Use [Image2Hex_Converter](https://github.com/RBahrami/Image2Hex_Converter "Image2Hex_Converter") to create input file (noisy image as hex file)
3. Run Main.do script
4. Use Image2Hex_Converter to open the output file and calculate results
